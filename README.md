# 🖥 My Journey towards DevOps!

This repository is being used to document my journey towards "DevOps". 

I like to call it a journal! 📒

In my opinion, DevOps is not really an entry-level job, and needs to learn so many things! Right now, I'm broke, need a job, and after overviewing my current skill-set, I think I should give this role a try! 

As I'm broke, my plan is to utilize all the available free resources and document my learning process, so that someday someone will get benefit from overviewing this repository. Although, you can say that this repository is more like a collection of my learning notes.

📌 *My advice will be, go through them, take a look, and if you don't know about a term or topic, you can always search Google to learn/know more!*

Hope, it will help!



> Anyway, my goal is to continue as long as I land a job. Wish me luck! 👊



As I'm definitely not an expert, I will have to go through many trials and errors. That's why I'm expecting that this repository will be messy. I apologize for that, but I think, one can relate to this more as a learner. At the same time, the language of this repository will be informal.

Also, I apologize for my bad English, I'm currently working on it too!
