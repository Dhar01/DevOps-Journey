# ðŸ–¥ My Journey towards DevOps! ðŸ–¥

This repository is used to document my journey towards "DevOps". I like to call it a journal!

In my opinion, DevOps is not really an entry-level job, and needs to learn so many things! Right now, I'm broke, need a job, and after overviewing my current skillset, I want to give it a try! As I'm broke, my plan is to utilize all the available free resources and document my learning process, so that someday someone will get benefit from overviewing this repository.

> The goal is to continue as long as I land a job. Wish me luck! ðŸ‘Š

As I'm definitely not an expert, I will have to go through many trials and errors. That's why I'm expecting that this repository will be messy. I apologize for that, but I think, one can relate to this more as a learner. The language of this repo will be informal. 

Also, I apologize for my bad English, I'm currently working on it too!
