Hi there! 👋

This is week 01!

In this week, I'm going to get a gentle introduction from [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-dev-ops) (*it's free of course!*) and learn some terms/idea/information about DevOps. 

For example:

- What is DevOps?
- DevOps Culture and Processes
- Infrastructure
- Monitoring
- Resiliency
- CI/CD Pipelines
